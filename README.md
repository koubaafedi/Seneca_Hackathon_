üéôÔ∏è AI LoL Commentator: Real-Time AI-Powered Esports Commentary for League of LegendsAI LoL Commentator Demo VideoOverviewWelcome to AI LoL Commentator, an innovative, AI-driven system that transforms ordinary League of Legends (LoL) gameplay into a dynamic, professional esports broadcast. This tool uses real-time data from the LoL Client and Live Client APIs to detect critical in-game events‚Äîsuch as kills, turret takedowns, and objectives‚Äîand generates energetic, exciting commentary on the fly.Powered by Google's Gemini AI for natural language generation and ElevenLabs for high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS), our system provides an immersive, audio-enhanced viewing experience. The project demonstrates a seamless pipeline for live, AI-powered narration, making it an ideal showcase for hackathon innovation.Why This MattersFor Viewers & Streamers: Adds a professional, engaging audio layer to streams and replays, elevating the viewer experience.For Esports: Serves as a prototype for automated commentary, scalable for lower-tier tournaments or dynamic highlight reel creation.For AI Enthusiasts: Combines API interaction, real-time event processing, and advanced LLM/TTS technologies into a functional, end-to-end application.How It Works: The AI-Driven Commentary PipelineThe system operates in a continuous, low-latency loop, monitoring the game state and narrating key moments.Data Acquisition: The program reads the LoL lockfile to securely connect to the local APIs. It then polls the League of Legends Client API (LCU) and Live Client API to fetch real-time game data, including player information and in-game events.Event Detection: The script actively listens for new events as they happen, such as:Game Start: "Welcome, everyone, to the ultimate battleground!"Champion Kills: "Oh, what a play! {KillerName} just took down {VictimName}!"Objective Takes: "The Infernal Dragon has fallen to Team Blue, and the power of the flame is now with them!"Player Stats: When no new events are detected, the system provides an update on a specific player's stats to maintain a continuous narrative flow.AI Commentary Generation: Game events and contextual player data are fed into the Gemini AI. The model, acting as a professional esports commentator, generates concise and impactful commentary.Audio Output: The generated text is instantly sent to the ElevenLabs API for conversion into a high-quality audio file. This audio is then played directly through your system's speakers, providing a truly live commentary experience.Key FeaturesReal-Time Event Tracking: Captures and narrates key moments like kills, objectives, and game starts as they happen.Direct API Integration: Utilizes the official LoL APIs for a fast, low-latency data stream without external scraping.Contextual & Dynamic AI: The Gemini model's chat history ensures that commentary is coherent and follows the game's evolving story.High-Fidelity Audio: ElevenLabs provides expressive, low-latency voice output for a professional feel.Spectator-Friendly: Operates non-intrusively in spectator mode, requiring no changes to the live game environment.User-Friendly Setup: A dedicated ui.py script guides you through the setup process and automatically creates the necessary .env file.Technologies UsedProgramming Language: Python 3.xAPIs:League of Legends Client API (LCU) & Live Client APIGoogle Gemini APIElevenLabs APILibraries:All required libraries are listed in requirements.txt.Setup & InstallationPrerequisitesThe League of Legends client installed and running a game in spectator mode. This is a mandatory step, as the app requires access to the game's lockfile.StepsClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/ai-lol-commentator.git](https://github.com/yourusername/ai-lol-commentator.git)
cd ai-lol-commentator
Install dependencies:All required packages can be installed from the requirements.txt file.pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the setup script:Execute the ui.py script. This will prompt you for your API keys and automatically create your .env file for you.python ui.py
Run the main application:With the LoL client open in spectator mode, run the main script to start the commentator.python main.py
Limitations & Future ImprovementsLatency: Commentary is dependent on the API polling interval. A future improvement would be to integrate with a WebSocket-based system for true real-time event pushing.Deeper Context: The current system focuses on major events. Future versions could integrate more nuanced data, such as item builds, gold leads, and player positions, for richer, more strategic commentary.Scalability: The current implementation is designed for a single spectator instance. Scaling to support multiple concurrent games would require a more robust backend architecture.LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
